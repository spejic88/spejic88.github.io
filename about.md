Hi my name is Sinisa Pejic, I am Web developer and Web enthusiast. My main area of interest is web programming (JS/Node.js, PHP/Symfony, Wordpress).
My other areas of interest are agile software development/project development and I occasionally I find myself doing some pen testing and Linux administration.
